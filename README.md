The given Python script is a simple keylogger that captures and logs every key pressed on the keyboard. It uses the `pynput` library to monitor keystrokes and the `logging` module to store the captured keys in a text file. The script first sets up a logging directory, specifying the `Documents` folder as the location to store the log file named **"Keylogs.txt"**. The `logging.basicConfig()` function is used to configure the logging settings, ensuring that each keystroke is recorded with a timestamp. The `on_press()` function is defined to handle key press events, converting the key object into a string and storing it in the log file. A try-except block is included to catch and print errors if any issues occur while logging. Finally, a `Listener` object from `pynput.keyboard` is created and started using a `with` statement, continuously monitoring keyboard input. The program runs indefinitely, logging all keystrokes until manually stopped, making it a basic but effective keylogger.
